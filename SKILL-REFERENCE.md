# Skill Reference - Quick Lookup

**Which files to reference for each type of task.**

Copy the `@file` references into your prompt to activate the relevant skills.
This repository uses agent-specific Markdown instruction files, not a shared skill layer.

## Everyday Coding (no extra reference needed)

Your AI agent **already loaded** the 6 Core Principles from the root instruction file (`CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, etc.). Just describe your task normally.

*(Note: If you have project-specific rules, add them to `PROJECT-STANDARDS.md`. The AI will automatically read it.)*

---

##  Dynamic Skill Auto-Discovery

Modern AI agents (Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code, Gemini with tools) are now equipped with **Auto-Discovery**. If your prompt mentions keywords like "Write tests", "Fix accessibility", or "Check security", the AI will *autonomously* read the relevant standard files below without you needing to manually `@reference` them.

Manual `@reference` is only required if you are using a standard web chatbot (without file-reading tools) or if you want to strictly force the AI to read a specific cookbook.

The root instruction file for each agent should still be the primary entrypoint; these references are task-specific additions, not a shared instruction surface.

The MCP server provides `agent-guidance-mcp_guidance(operation="search", query="your task")` to auto-discover relevant skills from the 168-skill catalog.

## Multi-Agent Setup

Assign the appropriate file as system instructions for each agent:

| Agent | File to load |
|-------|-------------|
| Coder | `@agent-guidance/multi-agent/coder-agent.md` |
| Test | `@agent-guidance/multi-agent/test-agent.md` |
| Reviewer | `@agent-guidance/multi-agent/reviewer-agent.md` |
| Documentation | `@agent-guidance/multi-agent/documentation-agent.md` |

---

## Combining References

For complex tasks, combine multiple references:

```
# Example: Build a secure API with tests

@agent-guidance/risk-management/security-constraints.md
@agent-guidance/prompts/sample-use-cases/create-api-with-rate-limiting.md
@agent-guidance/prompts/PROMPT-TEMPLATE.md

Build POST /api/v1/register with email validation,
bcrypt password hashing, and JWT response.
Include unit tests and Self-Check report.
```

---

## Verify Agent Skills

At any time, ask your agent:

> **"What coding standards are you following?"** or type **`/standards`**

Expected:
> [OK] AI-Coding-Standards with 6 Core Principles active.
