# Agent Guidance MCP — Priority Instructions

## Rule
Call `task_pipeline(task="<your task>")` FIRST before any other tool on this server.

## Why
- `task_pipeline` returns project context, recommendations, code search, and UI guidance in a single call.
- It prepares the AI with the full context needed for efficient tool usage.
- After it is called, all other tools become available.

## Gated tools (require task_pipeline first)
- guidance
- project_context
- ui_ux
- session_continuity

Note: workflow, precode_check, verify, and feedback were consolidated into
`guidance` operations (`operation="workflow"|"precode"|"verify"|"feedback"`).

## Always-available tools (no gate)
- health_check
- diagnose
- token_stats

## How to proceed
1. Call `task_pipeline(task="describe what you want to do")`
2. Use any other tool as needed
